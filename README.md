# PolitkScraper
Pulls text data from news outlets and builds datasets for them.

## How To Run

Python3 app.py

## Project Description

This application scrapes text data from the top ten largest news outlets in the USA. The data is cleaned, tokenized and saved in CSV format for ech respective media outlet.

## Use Cases For This Project

This data could be very helpful for a number of projects. Some examples include: 
* Analyzing text data to determine a bias.
* Fitting a language model to certain style of writing.
* News trend analysis.
* Data Mining
* Visualizations such as word cloud

## Future Work And Improvements

### Improvements

As of now, the top ten media outlets are hard coded in. This could be changed by some form of API request. 

The program does not filter out text related to the wesbite itself, i.e:information about the websites social media. I would like to ideally find a way to filter this out.

### Improvements

I hope to create a text-based menu system in which certain parameters (such as dates) can be defined. I also hope to include the option to plot the data and include clustering algorithm visualizations.
