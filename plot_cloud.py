Tom Cole (R-Okla.) arrives during a House Rules Committee hearing on the debt limit bill on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Listen 9 min Comment Gift  Article Share With just one more day to corral Republican support on a debt ceiling agreement, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) faced growing opposition from far-right members of his party but remained confident as the bipartisan bill passed a key procedural hurdle late Tuesday and headed to the House floor. Get the full experience. Choose your plan Roughly a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus took turns in a Capitol Hill news conference slamming McCarthy and the deal he brokered with President Biden over the weekend. And by the end of the day, roughly 30 GOP lawmakers had vowed to vote against the bill, which must clear the Senate and become law before Monday — the day the government would default on its debt without an extended borrowing cap. “This is a career-defining vote for every Republican,” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) said at the news conference. “Many more need to emerge [in opposition] if there is any path to salvaging what we began as a unified conference. … We’re prepared to stand up and take the slings and the arrows.” Advertisement Still, McCarthy played down criticism that he had failed to lock in enough spending cuts in the deal. And before the legislation was approved by the Rules Committee, he held on to his optimism that it would move through the panel — a key procedural step before Wednesday’s full House vote and typically the first stop before legislation can go before the full House. Throughout the day, influential GOP members streamed in and out of McCarthy’s office as the speaker fought to keep his conference together. “It’s the most conservative deal we ever had,” McCarthy told reporters. McCarthy also waved off rumblings that far-right members of his conference would move to vacate him as speaker. On Tuesday, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) did not rule out that option and said he had “concerns” about McCarthy, who won the speakership in January after 15 rounds of voting and multiple concessions. Advertisement “I do think that there has to be some kind of acknowledgment that this has not been best for the country, not been best for the Republicans, not been best for our body,” Biggs said. During the Freedom Caucus news conference, Bishop alone raised his hand when lawmakers were asked if they supported a motion to vacate. As the House Rules Committee convened Tuesday afternoon, most speakers acknowledged that the deal left both Democrats and Republicans unsatisfied. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) said he had yet to meet a single person who loved it. “Perhaps that is a sign that it is a fair compromise between a narrowly Republican House and a narrowly Democratic Senate — and, of course, a Democratic White House,” he said. Before Tuesday’s meeting, much attention was fixed on a handful of far-right Republicans on the Rules Committee who could have thwarted the bill’s future. Two of the panel’s nine GOP members — Reps. Ralph Norman (S.C.) and Chip Roy (Tex.) — had already come out against the deal and McCarthy’s leadership.

Chip Roy (R-Tex.) on May 30 decried an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and suggested that Republicans would face a “reckoning” over it. (Video: The Washington Post) But Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), a libertarian-minded conservative who sometimes sides with the Freedom Caucus, indicated he would vote to move the bill forward.  His support helped  the panel adopt the rule by a vote of 7-6. The bill will now head to the full House for a vote on Wednesday. “It’s not our job to imprint an ideology,” Massie said during the committee meeting. “I think our job is to decide: Is this a process we’ve all agreed on?” On Tuesday night, Republicans on the whip team were seen holding a narrow piece of paper with names in one hand and a pen in other, as they spent a roughly hour-long vote touching base with several colleagues in the larger Republican conference who remained undecided. Advertisement Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) told reporters Tuesday that she opposed the bill because “it doesn’t cut spending in the way that we should.” But she said any talk of whether McCarthy should hold on to the speaker’s gavel was “premature,” echoing other GOP lawmakers who say their focus is on the current debt ceiling bill. Meanwhile, Democrats risked losing members of their own conference. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, the leader of the House Progressive Caucus, said Tuesday that the group was still talking to its members to see where they stand so officials can decide whether they will endorse the deal as a group. Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, a member of the Progressive Caucus, said she was leaning against the bill. “As somebody who was a food stamp recipient, there is absolutely no way I can see myself greenlighting something that will take food from people’s mouths,” Bush said. Advertisement Across the Capitol, Senate leaders braced for what could turn into a long week or weekend, awaiting the House action and then maneuvering through their complex parliamentary procedures to finish up by Monday.  Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said there may be a weekend vote to get the legislation passed in time.
